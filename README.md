# airbnb-calgary
A visualization of Airbnb data from 2017 for the city of Calgary.  
This project was created for CMPT 384 - Information Visualization, a course offered at the University of Saskatchewan.

### Where the Data Came From:  
Contains information licensed under the Open Government Licence â€“ City of Calgary.  
The .geojson for the city of Calgary was downloaded at: https://data.calgary.ca/Base-Maps/Community-Boundaries/ab7m-fwn6  
  
The .csv containing the 2017 airbnb listing information for the city of Calgary was downloaded at: http://tomslee.net/airbnb-data-collection-get-the-data  
More specifically, the 2017-07-10 listings found in the zip file under the Calgary header.  
** Note: The .csv does not contain any data for the `min_stay` and `bathrooms` fields for any of the listings. The filter for these fields in my visualization *appear* to be broken because the dropdowns are not populated with options, but that is a direct result of this dataset.

The green shades for the listing prices were found by using [ColorBrewer](http://colorbrewer2.org/#type=sequential&scheme=Greens&n=6).
